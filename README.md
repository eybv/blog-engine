# üìù Blog Engine

**Blog Engine** is a demo project built on a custom lightweight Java framework (the [core](https://github.com/eybv/blog-engine/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/eybv/blog/core) module),
which implements fundamental principles of **MVC**, **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **routing**, **argument resolving**, as well as **HTTP request handling** and annotation processing.

The [engine](https://github.com/eybv/blog-engine/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/eybv/blog/engine) module is an example application (a blog) that uses this microframework. 
The main focus is the [core](https://github.com/eybv/blog-engine/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/eybv/blog/core) module,
which demonstrates an implementation similar to ***Spring Core*** and ***Spring MVC***, but built entirely from scratch.
